Welcome to my CPP learning projects repository! This repository contains various projects where I explore and practice different concepts and techniques in C++ programming. Each project focuses on a specific topic or problem set, allowing me to deepen my understanding of the language and its features.

## 📚 Learning Focus 📚
In each project, I will include a section detailing what I am currently learning or experimenting with. This will serve as a record of my progress and help me track my development as a C++ programmer.

## 🧐 About Solutions 🧐
Please note that the solutions provided in these projects may not always represent the most optimal or efficient approach. As I am still learning and refining my skills, there may be better ways to solve the problems presented. However, the primary goal of these projects is to learn and improve. Take also in consideration that there are subject constraints, some are not public, and sometimes create a convoluted exercise, but that is intentional. 

## 🛠 Development Environment 🛠
All projects in this repository are set up with development containers, linters, and formatters. Here's why these tools are important:

### 📦 Devcontainers 📦
Using development containers ensures a consistent and isolated development environment across different machines and operating systems. It helps manage dependencies and simplifies the setup process for new contributors or collaborators.

### 🧹 Linters 🧹
Linters analyze the source code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic inconsistencies, or suspicious constructs. By adhering to linting standards, I can write cleaner, more maintainable code and catch common mistakes early in the development process.

### 📐 Formatters 📐
Code formatters automatically enforce a consistent coding style throughout the project. This improves readability, reduces the time spent on manual formatting, and promotes a unified coding style across contributors.

By incorporating these utilities into my workflow, I aim to maintain code quality, improve collaboration, and streamline the development process.
